This project showcases the design and implementation of a **Matrix LED Display System** using **Arduino** and three **P10 LED panels**. The display is designed to provide dynamic, visually appealing messages and announcements for the Head of the Department of Computer Science, FUNAAB.  

### Key Features:
- Utilizes **P10 LED panels** for high-visibility displays.  
- Controlled via an **Arduino microcontroller** for seamless operation.    
- Efficient code architecture for smooth scrolling and static text modes.  
- Easy to modify and adapt for various display needs.  

This repository contains the complete source code.  

### Known Issues
- **Error:** Couldn't implement Bluetooth communication for customization as the Bluetooth module is not working.  
  - **Status:** Display functions properly despite this issue.

### Applications:
- Department announcements.  
- Event notifications.  
- Information dissemination in academic environments.  

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the project!
